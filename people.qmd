## Post-doctoral researchers

### Gonzalo García-Castro

::::: {.g-col-7}
I'm a researcher working on language acquisition and early language processing, using a combination of eye-tracking, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and computational modelling. Bayesian statistics are a big part of how I try to make sense of data, with a special focus on making my work computationally reproducible. I am currently involved in the Gates to Language Acquisition (GALA) investigating neonates' and Long-Evans rats' perception of syllables.

## PhD students

### Flora Chartier

I am a PhD student at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, enrolled in the PhD Program in Biomedicine. I am interested in the early acquisition & processing of language by infants, using different techniques such as behavioral ones, eye tracker and later, imaging. Before that, I obtained my master's degree in Integrative Biology and Physiology---specialized in Behavioral Neurosciences in La Sorbonne Université and spent a year working as a research engineer on the early acquisition of language in the INCC---Language & Cognition team in Paris. I am currently involved in the Gates to Language Acquisition (GALA) project investigating how babies, at only a few months old, perceive syllables.

## Staff

### Laura S. Piracún

::::: {.g-col-7}
I am currently working as a research assistant for the Gates to Language Acquisition (GALA) Project, where I invite families to participate in our studies, and I assist in data collection for our studies. I have obtained my master's degree in International Experimental and Clinical Linguistics at the University of Potsdam (Potsdam, Germany), and my bachelor's degree in psychology at Bethany College (Kansas, USA). I find myself very interested in the research aiming to understand language acquisition mechanisms and strategies, mainly focused on understudied populations, languages, and dialects.
