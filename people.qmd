I am a cognitive scientist specializing in language acquisition and comparative cognition. I serve as a **Principal Investigator** at the **Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu**. My research explores the cognitive mechanisms behind **language learning**, particularly how infants detect and categorize linguistic structures from an early age. I am also interested in **comparative cognition**, investigating whether similar learning processes exist in non-human species. Through my work, I aim to understand the **evolutionary roots of language and the fundamental principles guiding learning across species**.

I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology from the **University of Padova** in 2016, following a Master's degree in Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science from the same institution in 2013. After completing my doctorate, I pursued postdoctoral research at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison's Waisman Center**, focusing on infant language learning. In 2017, I joined the Speech Acquisition and Perception Group at **Universitat Pompeu Fabra** in Barcelona, where I investigated the acquisition of syntactic and syllabic structures, categorization processes, and infants' preferences for speech.

In 2024, I was awarded an **ERC Starting Grant** for my project **Gates to Language** (GALA), which aims to explore the evolutionary patterns of mechanisms involved in language learning across humans and non-human animals. Currently, continuing my research on statistical learning, infant language development, and animal cognition.

I am a post-doctoral researcher investigating **language acquisition** and **how young minds make sense of the world**. My work focuses on developmental psychology and psycholinguistics, studying how humans process language at different stages in development: from **newborns** to **infants**, **toddlers**, and **adults**. Under the GALA project, I investigate how neonates, infants, and non-human animals process different syllabic structures, searching for common mechanisms supporting language processing. To do this, I use a combination of **eye-tracking**, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (**fNIRS**), and **computational modelling**. with a special focus on **computational reproducibility**. **Bayesian statistics** are a big part of how I try to make sense of data.

In 2024 I obtained my PhD at the Center for Brain and Cognition, **Universitat Pompeu Fabra**, supervised by Prof. Núria Sebastian-Galles. I earned my BSc in Psychology from the **Universidad de Oviedo** in 2013, and my MSc in Neurosciences at the **Universitat de Barcelona** in 2018.

I am a **PhD student** at **Universitat Pompeu Fabra** in Barcelona, enrolled in the PhD Program in Biomedicine. I am interested in the **early acquisition and processing of language** by infants, using different techniques such as **behavioral** ones, **eye-tracking** and **fNIRS**.

I obtained my **MSc in Integrative Biology and Physiology**, specialized in Behavioral Neurosciences in **La Sorbonne Université** and spent a year working as a research engineer on the early acquisition of language in the **INCC**--Language & Cognition team in Paris. I am currently involved in the GALA project investigating **how babies, at only a few months old, perceive syllables**.

I work as research assistant for the GALA project. I facilitate research by aiding **data collection**, providing **logistic and administrative support**, and taking care of the call center to **invite families to participate** in our studies. I obtained my MSc in **International Experimental and Clinical Linguistics** at the **University of Potsdam** (Potsdam, Germany), and my **BA in Psychology** at **Bethany College** (Kansas, USA). I am very interested in research aiming to understand **language acquisition mechanisms** and strategies, with a special focus on **understudied populations, languages, and dialects**.
