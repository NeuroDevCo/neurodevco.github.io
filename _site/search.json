Bayesian statistics are a big part of how I try to make sense of data, with a special focus on making my work computationally reproducible. I am currently involved in the Gates to Language Acquisition (GALA) investigating neonates’ and Long-Evans rats’ perception of syllables."

I am interested in the early acquisition & processing of language by infants, using different techniques such as behavioral ones, eye tracker and later, imaging. Before that, I obtained my master’s degree in Integrative Biology and Physiology—specialized in Behavioral Neurosciences in La Sorbonne Université and spent a year working as a research engineer on the early acquisition of language in the INCC—Language & Cognition team in Paris. I am currently involved in the Gates to Language Acquisition (GALA) project investigating how babies, at only a few months old, perceive syllables."

Indeed, the little ones are known to very quickly pick up rules and habits of their language’s environment. We are mostly interested in the processing and segmentation of speech into small units like syllables. To study this, we use different techniques: behavioral ones, in which we take parameters such as the baby looking time and reaction to what they are listening to. We also use sophisticated techniques: eye-tracking (a technique used to track the infant’s gaze towards a target), or imaging techniques like the fNIRS (with a little cap on the baby’s head). In all experiments parents are at all times with their baby. This part of the project includes babies from 4 to 11 months old, and different linguistic environments are welcome!"
