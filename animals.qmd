Did you know that other animals are able to process and learn some properties of the human language? 
In our research group we are interested in taking a cross-species approach to understand the learning and processing of language. We use animal models like rats (*Rattus Norvegicus*) to test their ability to process syllables and words, two fundamental units of speech implemented as with auditory and vibrotactile stimuli.

Stay tuned!
