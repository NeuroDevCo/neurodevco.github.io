Did you know that **not only humans are able to communicate and process language**? In our research group we are interested in using a **comparative approach** to understand the **acquisition and processing of language**. For this, not only are we stuying humans but also **non-human animals**, like *Rattus Norvegicus*, to test their speech processing abilities, and in particular, **syllables**. With our research, we hope to be able to understand at a closer level the processing of the smallest units that make up language.
