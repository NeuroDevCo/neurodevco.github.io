Did you know that **not only humans are able to communicate and process language**? In our research group we are interested in using a **comparative approach** to understand the **acquisition and processing of language**, and more specifically, of syllabic structures. For this, we investigate human and non-human animals like *Rattus Norvegicus**, to test their perception of **syllables** at different levels. With our research, we hope to understand at a closer level the processing of one of the smallest units that make up language.
