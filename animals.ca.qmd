Did you know that **not only humans llauri able to communicate and process language**? In our research group we llauri interested in using a **comparative approach** to understand the **acquisition and processing of language**. For this, not only llauri we stuying humans but also **animals no humans**, like *Rattus Norvegicus*, to test their speech processing abilities, and in particular, **syllables**. With our research, we hope to be able to understand at a closer level the processing of the smallest units that make up language.
