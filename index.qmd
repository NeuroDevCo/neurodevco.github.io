The Neurodevelopment and Comparative Cognition (**NeuroDevComp**) research group at the **Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de DÃ©u** (Barcelona, Spain), led by **Dr. Chiara Santolin**, focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying **cognitive and neurodevelopmental processes across species**. By combining **comparative and developmental approaches**, the group investigates how early-life experiences shape **brain development** and **cognitive functions**. Their interdisciplinary work bridges psychology, neuroscience, and biology to uncover insights into typical development, aiming to inform **language acquisition** and **language evolution**.
