## Newborns

::: textbox
Language is the most complex communicative system known. Yet, most humans find it surprisingly easy to acquire language. What mechanisms support this readiness for language acquisition? This is one of the main research questions at the NeuroDevComp group, and neonates key to investigate it, since they still have not received extensive experience with language yet! To investigate this issue, we use a techique called fNIRS, in which we measure newborns' brain spontaneous activity in response to different parts types of speech.

## Infants

::: textbox
Our group research focuses on the early acquisition of language. We are interested in how babies can detect & process different parts of speech. Indeed, the little ones are known to very quickly pick up rules and habits of their language’s environment.  We are mostly interested in the processing and segmentation of speech into small units like syllables. To study this, we use different techniques: behavioral ones, in which we take parameters such as the baby looking time and reaction to what they are listening to. We also use sophisticated techniques: eye-tracking (a technique used to track the infant’s gaze towards a target), or imaging techniques like the fNIRS (with a little cap on the baby’s head). In all experiments parents are at all times with their baby. This part of the project includes babies from 4 to 11 months old, and different linguistic environments are welcome!
